# Advent of Code in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges implemented in Rust programming language.


## Structure

Each day's challenge is placed in its respective directory in the format `day-<number>`. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- `input.txt`: Input file containing the puzzle input for that specific day.
- `src/main.rs`: Rust source file containing the solution code.

## Running the Code

Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can get it from the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

To run the code for a specific day:

```bash
$ cd day-<number>
$ cargo run --bin part-<number>
```
